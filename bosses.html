            In Terraria, you will indefinitely encounter bosses throughout the land as you continue your vast venture in the world you created. It contains many animals you will encounter, some friendly, but allot will attempt to kill you through the night, so it's important to gear up to battle! </p>
          
           <p class="darknessfont">A such beginner boss you will have to fight is the Eye of Cthulhu. To spawn him you will need 6 lens from destroying 6 demon eyes at night, though he may become troublesome when he becomes enraged and the eyeball becomes a mouth where he does increased damage and different attack patterns, but it may be simple if you craft a bow and arrow with ice arrows!</p>


            <p class="darknessfont">As you venture further into the darkness, the more bosses you will be likely to encounter, and the better loot you will likely find, will help you get stronger to defeat the wall of flesh, which is the strongest boss you will fight in the normal run in terraria. If you die along your path, you shouldn't worry if you can get back to where you died to reclaim your money!</p>

           <p class="darknessfont">This may not be part of the expert mode, though, there are events that are enabled throughout the game updates, as it's usually updated from holliday updates and other things, there will be a christmas update soone ror later and special event boss fights to go with them!</p>
