            This is the main part of Terraria that'll help you get through the game, The gear you'll obtain! Right off the bat, you'll end up getting a pickaxe, an axe, and a sword, and there will be plenty of wood for you to build your first home. This will be the beginning of you getting vast ammounts of gear in this game. As you progress you'll encounter rarer ore's and you'll need to use an anvil and a furnace to craft the higher rarity ores and that helps you get the better weapons and armor.

                Continuing on, as you beat bosses you will obtain weapons as well as hammers and pickaxes, some such as the slime king will drop the slime gun, though it is completely useless but will also drop the slime hat as an accessory but you can keep your main armor on, the slime hat is just for cosmetic purposes. This goes for every majoy boss you encounter.

                The fun part is are the abilities your weapons will have, especially the rarity, as there are 11 tiers and 2 others which are Expert Tier which is rainbow, and Quest tier which is Amber. There are 11 total tiers as colors diffrentitate from how good a weapon is, letting purple weapons being the best, and Gray weapons considered "Weak", "Shameful", "Annoying", or "Broken" as the prefix before the weapons will usually tell if it's good or not.
